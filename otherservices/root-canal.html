            <h2>Root Canal in Manassas, VA</h2>
            <p>Are you having trouble chewing food on one side of your mouth? Do hot and cold liquids cause more sensitivity than before? Are you afraid to eat crunchy or hard foods because they might hurt your teeth or jaw?</p>
            <p>If so, you likely have an infected tooth, known as a root canal problem. A root canal is not a scary procedure. It's a simple treatment that can be completed right here at Chonky Dental Care.</p>
            <p>Chonky Dental Care offers affordable root canal services to patients in the Manassas, VA, area. To learn more about our affordable root canal services, keep reading!</p>
    
            <h3>What Is a Root Canal?</h3>
            <p>A root canal is a procedure to remove infected tissue inside a tooth's root. The root is part of the tooth that extends into the gums and jaw. The root is where bacteria can get trapped and cause significant pain, swelling, and infection. If not treated, the infection may spread to the jaw, facial bones, and other body areas.</p>
            <p>A root canal is needed when the tooth's nerve is infected. The nerve is an integral part of the tooth that lets us feel hot, cold, sweet, and sensitive touch. A tooth's nerve usually becomes infected from daily exposure to bacteria in saliva. This can happen due to an accident, improper oral care, or weakened tooth structure.</p>
    
            <h3>Why Get a Root Canal?</h3>
            <p>If you have an infected tooth, the best way to save the tooth is through root canal treatment. To save the tooth, the dentist will remove the infection, fill the root canal with a particular material, and seal the tooth with a filling material.</p>
            <p>The procedure is often painless and can be completed in just one visit. Once the infection is removed from the tooth, the rest of your body is safe from the bacteria, which means you don't need to take antibiotics or go to the doctor for treatment. A root canal allows you to keep your teeth and smile for life.</p>
    
            <h3>What Happens During a Root Canal?</h3>
            <p>During a root canal procedure, the dentist will numb the tooth and surrounding area. Then, the dentist will gently open the tooth and clean the infected tooth tissue from the inside. The dentist will then remove the infected area, fill the root canal with unique material, and seal the tooth with a filling material.</p>
            <p>The entire treatment time will depend on the tooth's condition and the number of teeth being treated. Once the infection is removed, the tooth and gums will heal naturally. The dentist will apply light pressure to the tissue to help it close and stop bleeding.</p>
    
            <h3>The Advantages of a Root Canal</h3>
            <p>A root canal is a great way to save a tooth with significant decay or damage to its structure. If left untreated, an infected tooth may start to hurt, swell, or lose its ability to feel temperature.</p>
            <p>The infection may spread to the rest of your body through your bloodstream. A root canal treatment is a great way to keep a tooth in your mouth so that you don't need to replace the tooth with a false one.</p>
    
            <h3>FAQs</h3>
            <p><strong>How painful is a root canal?</strong></p>
            <p>There is no doubt that a root canal can be a painful procedure. However, Chonky Dental Care will do everything possible to make you comfortable during the procedure. We use modern techniques and equipment to numb the area.</p>
            <p>This will help you relax and not feel pain during the root canal. Once the area is numb, you won't feel any pain or pressure. You may feel a slight pressure on your jaw, but it will not be painful.</p>
            <p><strong>Is a root canal worth the cost?</strong></p>
            <p>Root canals can be an expensive procedure, but they are worth every penny. In some cases, the bacteria may travel to other parts of your body and cause an infection that requires antibiotics and hospitalization. Root canal treatment is the only way to cure an infected tooth. However, the alternative is worse â€“ you may lose your tooth or spread the infection to your jaw and other body parts.</p>
            <p><strong>Do root canals weaken teeth?</strong></p>
            <p>Root canals do not weaken teeth or cause sudden breaks. A root canal strengthens a tooth and prevents future decay. To strengthen the tooth, the dentist fills the root canal with a material that will resist infection and wear and tear.</p>
            <p>The root canal process is long but worth it in the end. If you are concerned about the cost of the root canal procedure, Chonky Dental Care offers affordable root canal services in the Manassas, VA area.</p>
