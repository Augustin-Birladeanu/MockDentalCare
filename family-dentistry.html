            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            <div class="faq-list">
                <details>
                    <summary>What is Family Dentistry?</summary>
                    <p>Family dentistry is a branch of dentistry concerned with an entire family's oral health. This could include children and adults, parents, or grandparents in the family.</p>
                    <p>Family dentists are specially trained in general dentistry. This could include oral hygiene procedures, diagnosis, and treatment of dental diseases, as well as prevention and education for dental health. Family dentists often work in a team with pediatric dentists and orthodontists.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>What's the difference between a Family Dentist and a Pediatric Dentist?</summary>
                    <p>These are two different types of dentists that specialize in oral health. Family dentists are dentists who are trained in general dentistry, including diagnosing and treating oral diseases and other oral health issues. They also provide preventive oral care for the entire family.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, pediatric dentists specialize in children's oral health, including their oral development and health throughout childhood. The focus is on preventing cavities and other common oral diseases in children.</p>
                </details>

                <details>
                    <summary>How often does my child need to see the dentist?</summary>
                    <p>Visiting a dentist as early as possible can help to ensure that your child’s teeth are healthy and ready to last a lifetime. In addition to getting a cleaning, your child's first visit to the dentist is a great time to take care of any small problems, such as removing plaque and tartar that can build up on the teeth or figuring out if there is a problem with the way the teeth fit together.</p>
                    <p>We can also discuss good daily dental habits and brushing/flossing techniques to apply at home. Having a dental visit at a young age can minimize the amount of dental work your child may need as an adult.</p>
